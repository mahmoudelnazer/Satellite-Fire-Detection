# Satellite-Fire-Detection
Project description
Hundreds of forest fires burned over 9 million acres of land in 2015, causing millions of dollars in property damage and immeasurable loss and pain to those families affected.
So I collected data sets from Roboflow and Google and annotated them.
Then I used Yolo V5 to detect it.
